## Weather- Web App
As part of my coding projects, I developed a weather app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to enter a place name and retrieves real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, weather forecast for the entire day, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset time. The app utilizes a weather API to fetch and display accurate weather data.
# I have used  `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=(ENTER YOUR KEY FORM WEBSITE weatherapi.com)&q=${city}`
# I have used  `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=(ENTER YOUR KEY FORM WEBSITE weatherapi.com)&q=${city}`
To fetch the forecast and current data.
